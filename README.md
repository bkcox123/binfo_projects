# binfo_projects
Bioinformatics projects including rosalind practice problems and microarry/nextgen seq analysis

Data received from Rosalind shall be assigned to data folder. All users use this data. If a user would like to upload new data, download the folder, upload the new data file, then reupload the data folder again and commit directly to main branch.

Final output as a result of Rosalind data for each problem will be uploaded to a separate text file and assigned to output folder. Do the same as with the data folder.

Initially create pull request for all rosalind problems that does NOT commit to master branch. Only upload files to master branch after successful completion of the problem. Give pull request the name given by the rosalind problem.

Once users are satisfied with all possible answers and Rosalind agrees with final output, commit to master branch.
